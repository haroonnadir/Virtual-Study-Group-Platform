Abstract/Introduction<br>
The proposed project aims to develop an efficient Virtual Study Group Platform aims to facilitate collaboration among students by providing a web-based solution for organizing and participating in study groups. This platform will enable students to create groups, schedule study sessions, share resources, and engage in discussions, enhancing their learning experience and promoting effective teamwork. The solution will have both an Admin view and a User view, ensuring that both can access the features and functionalities that they require.
This web application will be developed using ASP.NET / PHP as the front end and SQL Server / MYSQL as the back-end. The database management system will store all necessary information about the items and their related information.<br>

Functional Requirements:

and discussions.
• Reporting: The system should generate reports on platform usage and
engagement metrics.
• System Configuration: The system should also be capable of managing platform
settings and integrations.
Non-Functional Requirements:
• Security: The solution will implement proper security measures to ensure that
customer and bakery owner data is protected.
• Performance: The system will be designed to handle a large number of
concurrent users and transactions, ensuring that the platform is always
available and responsive.
• Scalability: The system should be easily scalable to accommodate new
features and functionalities as the business grows.
