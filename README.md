Abstract/Introduction
The proposed project aims to develop an efficient Virtual Study Group Platform aims to facilitate collaboration among students by providing a web-based solution for organizing and participating in study groups. This platform will enable students to create groups, schedule study sessions, share resources, and engage in discussions, enhancing their learning
experience and promoting effective teamwork. The solution will have both an Admin view and
a User view, ensuring that both can access the features and functionalities that they require.
This web application will be developed using ASP.NET / PHP as the front end and SQL Server /
MYSQL as the back-end. The database management system will store all necessary information
about the items and their related information.
Functional Requirements:
1. User Authentication: The system should provide secure registration and login system
along with profile management with study preferences.
2. User Views
• Group Management: The system should provide an interface to create and join
study groups easily. It should also provide an effective mechanism to manage
group members and their rols.
• Scheduling: The developed system should be capable of scheduling study
sessions with automated reminders. Integration with Google Calendar is also
required.
• Resource Sharing: The system should provide a convenient interface to upload
and share study materials and notes. It should also provide facility to organize
resources by topics or subjects.
• Communication Tools: The platform should provide discussion boards for
asynchronous communication.
• Notifications: The should be capable of sending alerts for scheduled sessions and
new resources.
3. Admin View
• User Management: The platform should can approve or deny user registrations.
It should also monitor user activity and group interactions.
• Content Moderation: The system should review and manage shared resources
and discussions.
• Reporting: The system should generate reports on platform usage and
engagement metrics.
• System Configuration: The system should also be capable of managing platform
settings and integrations.
Non-Functional Requirements:
• Security: The solution will implement proper security measures to ensure that
customer and bakery owner data is protected.
• Performance: The system will be designed to handle a large number of
concurrent users and transactions, ensuring that the platform is always
available and responsive.
• Scalability: The system should be easily scalable to accommodate new
features and functionalities as the business grows.
• Usability: The solution will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive,
ensuring that customers and bakery owners can easily navigate the system and
